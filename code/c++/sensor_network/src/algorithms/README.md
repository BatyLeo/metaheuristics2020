## heuristic.h and heuristic.cpp

These files define the functions called by the interface to compute heuristic solutions.

## longest_paths.h and longest_paths.cpp

These files define the functions that implement basic computations in graphs, mainly longest paths.

## manual_modifications.h and manual_modifications.cpp

These files define the functions called by the interface to handle manual modifications on solutions.


## metaheuristic.h and metaheuristic.cpp

These files define the functions called by the interface to compute metaheuristic solutions.

## resource_flow_computation.h and resource_flow_computation.cpp

These files define the functions that implement the RCPSP heuristic parallel SGS with flow computation as well as the computation of usual priority rules.

## resource_flow_modification.h and resource_flow_modification.cpp

These files define the functions used to compute elementary flow modifications.
